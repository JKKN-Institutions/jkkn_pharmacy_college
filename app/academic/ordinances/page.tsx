                The TN Dr MGR Medical University has implemented the Sequel system as a progressive measure. Under this system, the institution retrieves the question paper just 15 minutes before the exam commencement. It is then handed over to the chief superintendent responsible for the proper conduct of the exam. To prevent malpractice, CCTV cameras are installed in the examination hall for continuous monitoring, and measures such as metal detectors and jammers are employed to prevent the use of electronic devices.

              <p className="mb-4">
                After the exams, the collected papers are promptly sealed and dispatched via the post office within the specified time frame for both forenoon and afternoon sessions. Invigilators (one faculty member per thirty students) are appointed to ensure the smooth execution of the examination process.

                Sessional examinations are also conducted with utmost confidentiality.
