              <strong>Student Query:</strong> A student at J.K.K.Nattraja College of Pharmacy received a drug information inquiry from a healthcare professional at the local hospital. The student at the Drug Information Centre researched the medications in question, consulted relevant pharmaceutical databases, and provided a comprehensive response to the inquiry. The exchange between the student and the healthcare professional can be documented as evidence of the Drug Information Centre's effectiveness. Additionally, tracking similar interactions and compiling a record of inquiries, responses, and outcomes can provide a broader picture of how the Drug Information Centre is contributing to practical learning and problem-solving for students.
