            It is a well known fact that there is a world-wide problem with the use and misuse of drugs because of the avalanche of drug products invading to the markets and ease of obtaining most of these drugs. Furthermore, the advances being made every day in drug therapy unfortunately create a drug information gap for the health care professionals. The provision of accurate and timely drug information to healthcare professionals is an important mechanism to promote safe and effective drug therapy. Such service is lacking in India.
          </p>

          <p className="text-justify">
            In recognition of all these facts, the J.K.K.Nattraja College of Pharmacy is established Drug information Center (DIC). The purpose of establishing the DIC is basically to provide a service for physicians, pharmacists, health care personnel and the public.
          </p>

          <p className="text-justify">
            The center is particularly useful when the usual sources of drug information fail to provide a solution. By contacting the center usually by verbal, telephone or mail, health professionals can in most cases quickly obtain up-to-date information, pertinent to any question about the use and misuse ofdrug, poison and antidote. The center's personnel usually do not participate directly in the decision-making process ofpatient care, but perform a valuable supportive role which culminates in improved patient care. Briefly, the ultimate goal of this Center is to ensure that the best quality health care services are made to the patients.
